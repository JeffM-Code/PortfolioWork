## Project
Imbalance pricing insights<br><br>

## Info
The wholesale electricity market is set up so that supply should always meet demand on the transmission system, thorough ensuring the contracts between parties including organizations that require electricity for their customers (Suppliers) and organizations that produce
electricity (Generators) are such that balancing actions given to a party, are in accordance with agreed rules, to either increase or decrease generation, or increase or decrease demand, depending on the appropriate balancing action, and the dataset utilized pertains to this balancing act, more specifically referred to as **imbalance pricing**.<br><br>
Using data acquired on energy trading under energy balancing, the idea's to apply machine learning to derive valuable insights based on the data through prediction of volume / price (forecasting), understanding of variable relationship (regression) e.g., impact of volume on price, classification of periods of low demand or price (classification), and pattern segmentation (K-Means clustering).<br><br>
