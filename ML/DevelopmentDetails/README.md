## Model development information
Growing my understanding of MLOps has meant explicitly structuring my workflows to solve a given problem. So, for each model developed, a problem was determined at the started, and solved at the end through a machine learning model, and data.<br><br>

#### Workflow:<br><br>

*General model development workflow*<br><br>

The question to be answered by an ML model is then packaged into an interactive application at the end, as I believe that helps any reader understand the output of the application, to understand the motivations underpinning its development.<br><br>

Next goal is to write code for an ML pipeline using sklearn.
