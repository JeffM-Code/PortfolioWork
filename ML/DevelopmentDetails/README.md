# Model development information
Growing my understanding of MLOps has meant explicitly structuring my workflows to solve a given problem.<br><br>

So, for each model developed, a problem was understood and defined, and solved at the end through a machine learning approach. Some models were'nt published as data was difficult to interpret, or poorly documented, so I normally like to proceed with appropriate documentation, as it helps ensure high model performance, so even it's quality is not ideal, I can at least do the necessary data engineering to make it ideally usable.<br><br>

## Workflow<br><br>

*General model development workflow*<br><br>

Problem understanding and definition for each model was done, to ensure high relevancy to personal domain expertise (energy / physics) to ensure understanding and interpretation of model performance was realized. Deployment simply means packaging into interactive application on Streamlit, but ideally an AWS or Azure cloud platform would be ideal, especially for automating the feedback loops presented in the diagram, and deployment efforts were extensive as I believe that this helps any reader understand the output of the application, to understand the motivations underpinning its development.<br><br>
