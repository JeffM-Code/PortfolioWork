# Model Development
<br><br>Growing my understanding of MLOps has meant explicitly structuring my workflows in solving a given problem, to optimize chances of successful model experiments. So, I developed this workflow to help ensure consitency in the quality of my developed models.<br><br><br>

## Personal Workflow<br><br>

*General model development workflow**<br><br><br>

Utilization of cloud technologies (AWS, Azure, or GCP) can help automate most aspects of this workflow, for greater efficiency and model performance. I am constantly growing my Azure and AWS cloud engineering skills, so I hope to be able to architect end-to-end ML solutions in that way, as it's more robust.<br><br>

For instance, through Azure:<br><br>

And through AWS:<br><br>

My goal is to apply cloud solution architectures to proposed problems, with AWS and Azure.
