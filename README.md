# âš¡ Projects<br>
I have a very data-driven stance and approach to problem solving, as I believe there's a lot of potential in value from data in informing exceptional decision making, and I engineer and analyze solutions to problems that these projects should demonstrate. Hope they make for an interesting read.<br><br>

### Problem sets:<br><br>
I also practice solving machine learning problems from this book: https://mml-book.github.io/, for understanding models more theoretically.<br><br>
