# âš¡ Projects<br>
I have a very data-driven stance and approach to problem solving, as I believe there's a lot of potential in value from data in informing exceptional decision making, and I engineer and analyze solutions to problems that these projects should demonstrate. Hope they make for an interesting read.<br><br>

General, and specific model development is documented, and interactive applications for some are available as well.
