# Projects<br>
I have a very data-driven stance and approach to problem solving, as I believe there's a lot of potential in value from data in informing exceptional decisions, and I engineer and analyze solutions to problems that these projects should demonstrate. Hope they make for an interesting read.<br><br><br>

## Machine Learning<br>
* [Building heating / cooling efficiency modelling](https://github.com/JeffM-Code/PortfolioWork/tree/main/ML/BuildingEnergyEfficiency)<br><br>
* [Micro gas turbine energy consumption](https://github.com/JeffM-Code/PortfolioWork/tree/main/ML/GasTurbineConsumption)<br><br>

Models development is documented, and interactive applications of each model are available as well.<br><br>

## Data Analytics<br>
#### PowerBI Visualisations*

    * Assessment on highly profitable items to recommend most profitable item to stakeholder.<br><br>

Data was queried from BigQuery on 400M+ row datasets, with dashboards being made in PowerBI. I've included alternative links, in case the interactive PowerBI links don't work.<br><br>
