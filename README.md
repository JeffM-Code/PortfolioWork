# Projects
### Data Analytics<br>
My projects in data analytics where completed using large datasets in BigQuerry, to unlock insightful details and to provide strong, actionable recommendations based on the analytical work completed. Those recommendations, were then presented to relevant stakeholders, to promote a data-driven approach to decision-making.<br><br>

### Machine Learning<br>
ML work showcase to reinforce own understanding of the field. Most of the work is based on energy, as I personally have the most experience with that specific domain. Am also trying to incorporate as data science to all ML projects as well, as I am also currently studying that field.<br><br>
