### Data Analytics<br>
My projects in data analytics where completed using large datasets in BigQuerry, to unlock insightful details and to provide strong, actionable recommendations based on the analytical work completed.<br><br>

### Machine Learning<br>
ML work showcase, reinforcing own understanding of field. Most work on energy as I have experience with that specific domain. Trying to incorporate some data science work in ML projects as well, as I am also studying that field.<br><br>

ML models determined predict:<br>
* Heating & cooling efficiency for building
* Energy consumption for micro gas turbine
