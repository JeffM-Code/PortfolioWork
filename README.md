# Projects<br>
I work on projects utilizing data to solve problems, because I am a firm believer in putting data to work for data-driven decision making, and will continue to grow this portfolio with those types of projects in mind. I try to include as much interactivity with my work as possible, through notebooks or intractable dashboards, to help the reader better understand the data or valuable insights presented, and hope that it's at least an interesting read.<br><br><br>

### Data Analytics<br><br>
[Projects](https://github.com/JeffM-Code/PortfolioWork/tree/main/DataAnalytics)<br>

Projects in data analytics were completed using large datasets in BigQuerry, to unlock insightful details and to provide strong, actionable recommendations based on the analytical work completed.<br><br>

### Machine Learning<br><br>
[Projects](https://github.com/JeffM-Code/PortfolioWork/tree/main/ML)<br>

ML work showcase to reinforce own understanding of the field. Most of the work is based on energy, as I personally have the most experience with that specific domain. Am also trying to incorporate some data science to all ML projects as well, as I am also currently studying that field.<br><br>

As I continue to learn ML, data science and data analytics, I am constantly reinforcing my learning with a complete project, so I am normally working on more projects that I should be able to showcase after I make sure they are at least interesting and informative to read for better engagement, to avoid something uninteresting and not worth the time.
